## Restoring the Database from a .bak File

This project uses a SQL Server database, and to get started, you'll need to restore the database from a .bak (backup) file. Follow these steps:

1. **Obtain the .bak File:**
   - Ensure you have a copy of the .bak file for this database. If you don't have it, please contact the administrator or owner of the database.

2. **Launch SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):**
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio, a graphical tool for managing SQL Server databases. If you don't have SSMS installed, you can download it from [Microsoft's website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).

3. **Connect to SQL Server:**
   - Open SSMS and connect to your SQL Server instance where you want to restore the database. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform this operation.

4. **Restore the Database:**
   - In SSMS, in the Object Explorer, right-click on "Databases."
   - Choose "Restore Database."

5. **Specify Source and Destination:**
   - In the "General" section, select "Device" as the source.
   - Click the "..." button to browse for the .bak file.
   - Select your .bak backup file.
   - In the "To database" field, specify the name of the database you want to create or overwrite with the backup data.

6. **Restore Options (Optional):**
   - You can configure various options such as overwriting existing database files, specifying a new location for database files, or enabling options like "Overwrite the existing database." Adjust these options based on your requirements.

7. **Review and Confirm:**
   - Review the settings on the "General" page and make sure they are configured as desired.

8. **Initiate the Restore:**
   - Click the "OK" button to start the database restore process. The progress will be displayed.

9. **Confirmation:**
   - Once the process is complete, you should see a success message. The restored database is now available for use.

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to restore databases, and be cautious when restoring databases as it can overwrite existing data. Make sure to back up any data you want to preserve before performing the restore operation.

For command-line users, you can also use `sqlcmd` to restore the database. Here's an example command:

```bash
sqlcmd -S ServerName -U Username -P Password -Q "RESTORE DATABASE [YourDatabaseName] FROM DISK = 'C:\Path\To\YourDatabase.bak' WITH REPLACE;"
